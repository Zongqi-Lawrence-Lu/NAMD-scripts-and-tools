Given a concatenated dcd file, extracts at certain time stamps and write the coordinates and periodic boundary files
This can be used as starting points for SMwST (String Method with Swarms of Trajectories)

Usage:
1. Convert the (SMD input) trajectory into a one single trajectory (use catdcd)
2. Specify the inputs and dcd file
3. In the arr=() space, write the desired time, in ns, as an array
